<p>In 1872, the author of the present work at Sacramento,
California, commenced an investigation with the object of
illustrating by photography some phases of animal movements.
In that year his experiments were made with a
famous horse&mdash;Occident, owned by Senator Stanford&mdash;and
photographs were made, which illustrated several
phases of action while the horse was trotting at full speed,
laterally, in front of the camera.</p>

<p>The experiments were desultorily continued; but it was
not until 1877 that the results of any of them were published.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile he devised an automatic electro-photographic
apparatus, for the purpose of making consecutive
photographic exposures at <i>regulated</i> intervals of
time or of distance. Some of the results of his experiments
with this apparatus, which illustrated successive
phases of the action of horses while walking, trotting,
galloping, &amp;c., were published in 1878, with the title of
"<span class="smcap">The Horse in Motion</span>." Copies of these photographs were
deposited the same year in the Library of Congress at
Washington, and some of them found their way to Berlin,
London, Paris, Vienna, &amp;c., where they were commented
upon by the journals of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1882, during a lecture on "The Science of Animal
Locomotion in its relation to Design in Art," given at the
Royal Institution (see <i>Proceedings</i> of the Royal Institution
of Great Britain, March 13, 1882), he exhibited the
results of some of his experiments made during a few
antecedent years at Palo Alto, California; when he, with
the zoopraxiscope and an oxy-hydrogen lantern, projected
on the wall a synthesis of many of the actions he had
analysed.</p>

<p>It may not be considered irrelevant if he repeats what
he on that occasion said in his analysis of the quadrupedal
walk:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So far as the camera has revealed, these successive
foot fallings are invariable, and are probably common to
all quadrupeds....</p>

<p>"It is also highly probable that these photographic investigations&mdash;which
were executed with wet collodion
plates, with exposures not exceeding in some instances
the one five-thousandth part of a second&mdash;will dispel many
popular illusions as to the gait of a horse, and that future
and more exhaustive experiments, with the advantages
of recent chemical discoveries, will completely unveil to
the artist all the visible muscular action of men and
animals during their most rapid movements....</p>

<p>"The employment of automatic apparatus for the purpose
of obtaining a regulated succession of photographic
exposures is too recent for its value to be properly understood,
or to be generally used for scientific experiment.
At some future time the explorer for hidden truths will
find it indispensable for his investigations."</p>

<p>In 1883, the University of Pennsylvania, with an enlightened
exercise of its functions as a contributor to
human knowledge, instructed the author to make, under
its auspices, a comprehensive investigation of "Animal
Locomotion" in the broadest significance of the words.</p>

<p>L, a horizontal battery of electro-photographic cameras,
parallel to the line of motion (at a distance of 15 metres
or about 48 feet therefrom), for a series of 12 lateral
exposures.</p>

<p>R, a vertical battery of electro-photographic cameras,
at right angles to the lateral battery, for a series of 12
<i>rear</i> foreshortenings.</p>

<p>F, a horizontal battery of electro-photographic cameras,
at any suitable angle to the lateral battery for a series of
<i>front</i> foreshortenings.</p>

<p>O, the position of the electric batteries, a chronograph
for recording the time intervals of exposures, and other
apparatus used in the investigation.</p>

<p>A clock-work apparatus, set in motion at the will of the
operator, distributed a series of electric currents, and
synchronously effected consecutive exposures in each of
the three batteries of cameras.</p>

<p>The intervals of exposures were recorded by the chronograph,
and divided into thousandths of a second. These
intervals could be varied at will from seventeen one-thousandth
parts of a second to several seconds.</p>

<p>The task of making the original negatives was completed
in 1885; the remaining years have been devoted
to the preparation of the work for publication.</p>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PLATES" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PLATES">DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.</a></h2>


<p>The results of this investigation are</p>

<p><b>Seven Hundred and Eighty-one Sheets of Illustrations</b>,
containing more than 20,000 figures of men, women, and
children, animals and birds, actively engaged in walking,
galloping, flying, working, jumping, fighting, dancing,
playing at base-ball, cricket, and other athletic games, or
other actions incidental to every-day life, which illustrate
motion or the play of muscles.</p>

<p>These sheets of illustrations are conventionally called
"plates."</p>

<p>Each plate illustrates the successive phases of a single
action, photographed with automatic electro-photographic
apparatus at regulated and accurately recorded intervals
of time, <i>consecutively</i> from one point of view; or, <i>consecutively</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">AND</span> <i>synchronously</i> from <i>two</i>, or from <i>three</i> points of
view.</p>


<p><b>Each Plate is complete in itself without reference to
any other Plate.</b></p>

<p>When the complete series of twelve consecutive exposures,
from each of the three points of view, are included
in <span class="smcap">One</span> Plate, the arrangement is usually thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The plates are not <i>photographs</i> in the common acceptation
of the word, but are printed in <span class="smcap">Permanent Ink</span>, from
gelatinised copper-plates, by the New York Photo-Gravure
Company, on thick linen plate-paper.</p>

<p>The size of the paper is 45 × 60 centimetres&mdash;19 × 24
inches, and the printed surface varies from 15 × 45 to
20 × 30 centimetres&mdash;6 × 18 to 9 × 12 inches.</p>

<p>The number of figures on each plate varies from 12 to
36.</p>

<p>To publish so great a number of plates as one undivided
work was considered unnecessary, for each subject tells its
own story; and inexpedient, for it would defeat the object
which the University had in view, and limit its acquisition
to large Libraries, wealthy individuals, or Institutions
where it would be beyond the reach of many who might
desire to study it.</p>

<p>It has, therefore, been decided to issue a series of One
Hundred Plates, which number, for the purposes of publication,
will be considered as a "<span class="smcap lowercase">COPY</span>" of the work. These
one hundred plates will probably meet the requirements of
the greater number of the subscribers.</p>

<p>In accordance with this view is issued the following</p>

<p>This is not exactly the place nor the time for the Author
to express his obligations and thanks to those gentlemen
who have assisted him in his labours, but it affords a
perhaps not inappropriate opportunity for him to pay a
tribute of gratitude to his recently deceased friend M.
Meissonier, without whose enthusiastic encouragement it
is probable the present work would never have been
undertaken.</p>

<p>In 1882 he invited his friends to attend an illustrated
Lecture given in his studio by the Author, and then
referring to a full knowledge of a subject being necessary
for it to be truthfully or satisfactorily translated by the
artist, declared how much his own impression of a horse's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
motion had been changed after having carefully studied
its consecutive phases. Attention need not be directed to
the modifications in the expression of animal movements
now progressing in the works of the Painter and the
Sculptor.</p>

<p>The investigations of the Author are so well known, and
so generally recognised as affording the only basis of truthful
interpretation or accurate criticism of Animal Movement,
that it is unnecessary to quote from the many
elaborate reviews of "Animal Locomotion," which have
been published in the American, English, French, and
German Scientific, Artistic, and other Journals.</p>

<p>For the value of the present work to the general
student of Nature and the lover of Art, no less than to the
Artist and the Archæologist, the Physiologist and the
Anatomist, it is with much pride and gratitude that he
refers to the annexed list of some of his European subscribers.</p>

Transcriber's Note:
</p>
<p>
Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
possible.
</p>
<p>
The author spelled Greifswald as Griefswald, Innsbruck as Innsbrück
and Häuser as Haüser in this text. These spellings have been retained.
</p>
<p>
In the diagram on p. 7, the length of 9' 19" appears to be a typo for 19' 9".

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
